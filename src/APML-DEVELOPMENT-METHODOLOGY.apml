    title: "APML-First Development Principles"
    subtitle: "The foundational practices that make APML development systematic and maintainable"
    
    display principle_1:
      name: "Specifications as Single Source of Truth"
      description: "All application logic, structure, and behavior is defined in APML specifications"
      rationale: "Eliminates drift between documentation and implementation. Ensures systematic evolution of applications."
      example: "When adding a new feature, modify the APML specification and recompile - never edit generated code directly"
      anti_pattern: "Manually editing Vue components, then trying to reverse-engineer the APML specification"
    
    display principle_2:
      name: "Edit APML, Never Generated Code"
      description: "Generated code is read-only. All changes flow through APML specifications."
      rationale: "Maintains consistency between specification and implementation. Enables regeneration without losing changes."
      example: "To fix CSS styling, update the theme specification or compiler CSS generation logic"
      anti_pattern: "Editing generated .vue files directly, losing changes on next compilation"
    
    display principle_3:
      name: "Compiler-Driven Architecture"
      description: "The Ultimate APML Compiler is the authoritative translator from specifications to applications"
      rationale: "Centralizes all generation logic. Improvements to the compiler benefit all applications instantly."
      example: "Enhancing mobile responsiveness in the compiler improves all generated applications simultaneously"
      anti_pattern: "Creating manual workarounds in individual components instead of systematic compiler improvements"
    
    display principle_4:
      name: "Systematic Over Manual"
      description: "Always choose systematic solutions that work across all applications over one-off manual fixes"
      rationale: "Scales improvements across entire ecosystem. Reduces technical debt and maintenance burden."
      example: "Adding navigation logic to the compiler rather than hardcoding routes in individual files"
      anti_pattern: "Quick manual fixes that solve immediate problems but create maintenance debt"
