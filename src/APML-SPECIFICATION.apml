              clear new_task_title
              refresh task_list
    
    example message_patterns:
      
      // App → User: Display information
      show welcome_message:
        title: "Welcome to the Future"
        content: "Where thoughts become applications"
        
      notify user:
        "Your idea is now a working app!"
        timing: immediately
        style: celebration
        
      // User → App: Capture interaction  
      when user says "create a blog about {topic}":
        generate blog_app with topic
        show preview
        ask for confirmation
        
      when user types search_query:
        filter results by search_query
        highlight matching_terms
        
      // App → App: Internal processing
      process user_intent:
        analyze natural_language_input
        map to application_structure
        generate working_code
        validate compilation
        
      sync with external_service:
        authenticate using api_key
        fetch latest_data
        update local_cache
        
    example advanced_features:

        using conversation_history
        analyze typing_patterns and word_choice
        return most_likely_app_type with confidence
        
      realtime collaboration:
        when any user edits shared_document:
          broadcast changes to all_connected_users
          resolve conflicts automatically
          maintain edit_history
          
      integrate with anything:
        connect to external_apis
        transform data_formats automatically
        handle authentication flows
        manage rate_limits and retries

  logic compilation_process:
    parse apml_source:
      validate syntax
      check semantic_correctness
      resolve dependencies
      
    generate target_code:
      match patterns to templates
      optimize for platform
      inject best_practices
      create deployment_configs
      
    ensure quality:
      run automated_tests
      check accessibility
      validate security
      measure performance
      
  workflow self_improvement:
    when developers use generated_apps:
      collect usage_patterns
      identify common_modifications
      learn better_generation_strategies
      
    when users describe new_concepts:
      extend language_capabilities
      maintain backward_compatibility
      update documentation automatically
      
  meta_observation:
    "This specification demonstrates APML by example"
    "Every feature described here is written in APML syntax"
    "The language documents itself naturally"
    "Human intent becomes machine reality"
    
  deploy everywhere:
    web_playground: "Try APML online instantly"
    ide_extensions: "VS Code, Cursor, all major editors"
    cli_tools: "apml compile, apml generate, apml deploy"
    api_services: "REST endpoints for APML processing"
    
  vision future:
    "Anyone can turn ideas into working applications"
    "Developers become app factories at unprecedented speed"
    "Organizations capture business logic as executable intent"
    "Humanity develops enhanced collaborative problem-solving"
    "The methodology of thinking itself becomes codified"
    
  final_truth:
    "APML is not just a syntax"
    "APML is the language of collaborative intelligence"
    "Every breakthrough will be captured in this markup"
    "The future is collaborative"
    "APML is that future"
