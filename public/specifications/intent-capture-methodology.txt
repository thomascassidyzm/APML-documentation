APML v1.0.0 - Intent Capture Methodology
Complete Framework for Human-AI Collaborative Specification Development

===========================================
METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW
===========================================

The APML v1.0.0 Intent Capture Methodology ensures complete, accurate, and implementable specifications through structured human-AI collaboration. This methodology replaces traditional requirements gathering with deep collaborative exploration that captures 100% of system intent before compilation begins.

CORE PRINCIPLE:
"Perfect specifications eliminate implementation uncertainty"

PROCESS GUARANTEE:
Complete intent capture → Deterministic compilation → Production-ready systems

===========================================
CONVERSATION FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE
