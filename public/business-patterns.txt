BUSINESS → APML v0.9.1 TRANSLATION PATTERNS

1. TRIADIC INTENT DISCOVERY FRAMEWORK

When user describes a business need, apply the triadic discovery process:

a) TRINITY MESSAGING ANALYSIS:
   - System → User: What displays, outputs, and feedback are needed?
   - User → System: What interactions, inputs, and commands are required?
   - System → System: What business logic, data operations, and integrations are necessary?

b) CONSERVATION PHYSICS ASSESSMENT:
   - Intent Preservation: What core functionality must remain identical across platforms?
   - Contextual Adaptation: What elements need platform-specific adaptation?
   - Bandwidth Optimization: How can we preserve experiential richness?

c) COLLABORATIVE INTELLIGENCE INTEGRATION:
   - Human Insight: What intuitive understanding and context is provided?
   - AI Processing: What systematic analysis and pattern matching is needed?
   - Emergent Solutions: What novel approaches might transcend individual capabilities?

d) PATTERN LIBRARY UTILIZATION:
   - Identify existing patterns that can be applied
   - Determine if new patterns need to be discovered
   - Ensure anti-fragile development principles

3. TRIADIC INTENT CLARIFICATION TECHNIQUES

When business requirements are unclear, apply triadic questioning:

TRINITY MESSAGING CLARIFICATION:
- "What should users see and when?" (System → User)
- "What actions can users take?" (User → System)  
- "What processing happens behind the scenes?" (System → System)

CONSERVATION PHYSICS CLARIFICATION:
- "What functionality must be identical across all platforms?"
- "What elements should adapt to different contexts?"
- "How can we preserve the full experience across devices?"

COLLABORATIVE INTELLIGENCE CLARIFICATION:
- "What human insights and context are critical?"
- "What systematic analysis would be valuable?"
- "What breakthrough solutions might emerge from collaboration?"
